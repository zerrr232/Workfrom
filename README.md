# Workfrom – Hackathon Project

Workfrom is a team project developed during a web development hackathon. The challenge was to **revamp and enhance an existing website** for _Workfrom_, a company that offers flexible room rentals for meetings, events, and other professional needs.

Our goal was to improve the website’s design, user experience, and functionality to better showcase the services offered and make the booking process more intuitive.

## 🔧 Project Objectives

- Redesign the UI/UX to enhance user engagement
- Implement responsive layouts for various devices
- Improve navigation and content structure
- Optimize performance and accessibility
- Refactor legacy code for better maintainability
